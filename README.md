My portfolio website

This is the files for my main portfolio website. I'm still working on it. I've only made 2 small projects.
I'll publish it on my main profile, once it's ready and I have more to show ot it.

It runs with python code through a site called: https://www.pythonanywhere.com/

You can see all my files that I've made here so far, (maybe some img files are missing, but I'll upload everything once it's done).

OK OK! I guess you can have a look at my progress http://arisstampolidis.pythonanywhere.com but it's not ready yet. Not even my bio is written yet.
